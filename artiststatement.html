<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p>My artworks show how versatile I am at expressing myself about topics that I care about through different mediums. Having a myriad of ways to express myself in different mediums gives me the freedom that I've always wanted as a child. When it comes to drawing, I really open myself up more to how I express myself. My inspiration for the way I draw comes from a lot of kung fu movies that I’ve watched including Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and many other kung fu movie stars that I’ve come to be a fan of. However, Bruce Lee holds a special place in my heart specifically because my dad is a big fan of his work. His techniques have greatly inspired how I wanted to convey it through 2D and 3D animation given how much time he has put into perfecting the techniques. The One Inch Punch is a standout technique due to its immense speed and power needed to execute properly. Given how much technical prowess was needed to pull this technique off, it gives me leeway to be able to express that passion is through game design.</p>

<p>Game design has always been in the back of my mind ever since I got into video games. At the time I never really had any way of conveying my interest for video games so thats where I turned to drawing. Drawing opened up the freedom to imagine how action scenes would be composed within a piece of paper.</p>
