<h1>3D Print</h1>

<p>The 3D printing process was quite an experience. The first time I printed it, I made it too small. I was satisfied with the size so I doubled the size. It still was still 2D so I needed to add extra blocks to where the face and body would be noticeably visible. I still remember how hard it was to get rid of the stifles due to how stitched in the stifles were on the empty spaces of the 3D print. Making the choice of lying the kirby flat really got rid of those issues.</p>
