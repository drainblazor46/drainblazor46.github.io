<h1>Minecraft Art</h1>

<p>One of the Minecraft Arts that I decided to create was Kirby. Kirby is an iconic character from my childhood growing up. When I had the Nintendo DS, I always played a lot of Kirby: Superstar Ultra which was a compilation of previous Kirby games stuffed into one cartridge. It was great because there was so much content to be enjoyed. I also was a big fan of the animated series of Kirby: Right Back At Ya! which was considered to be one of my favorite Saturday Morning cartoons. It was cool to see all of his different forms that he would accumulate throughout the games to be fully realized in an anime so that was pretty awesome. Also I didnâ€™t know for the longest time that Masahiro Sakurai who made notable games like Kid Icarus: Uprising and the Super Smash bros games was the person to think up a concept like Kirby to become a video game icon.</p>
